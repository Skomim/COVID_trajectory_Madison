# ohiCovidMetrics 0.1.0

This is a minimally viable product that can download the Historical Data 
Table from the DHS website and produce the Confirmed Case Metric file for
export to Tableau for the Dashboard. 

The only data source supported is the Historical Data Table that is posted 
on the DHS website. The calculations are the ones described in the OHI
Confirmed Case Metric Reproducibility document. *Note: they are the ones
described as 'defined as' not the ones that are 'proposed'.*

# ohiCovidMetrics 0.0.0.9000
