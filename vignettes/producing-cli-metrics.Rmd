This document explains how we calculate the Covid Like Illness (CLI) metrics 
for ingestion into Tableau. The process described below is similar to the one
used for the confirmed case metrics. *NOTE: These data are not currently publicly 
posted, so this document includes a simulated data source in place of the 
real data.*

```{r setup}
library(ohiCovidMetrics)
```
