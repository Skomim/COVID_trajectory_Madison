class_burden(burden)

\description{
Currently, cutoff values are hard coded and adopted straight from
the ones used in the CDC State Indicators report:
\itemize{
  \item "Low" is a burden less than or equal to 10 per 100,000
  \item "Moderate" is a burden greater than 10 and less than or equal to 50 per 100,000
  \item "Moderately High" is a burden greater than 50 and less than or equal to 100 per 100,000
  \item "High" is a burden greater than 100
}
}
\examples{
burd <- score_burden(curr = 100L, prev = 80L, population = 65432)
burd_c <- class_burden(burd)
}
